                Hey! I&apos;m Bob, if you haven&apos;t already gathered that by
                now. I&apos;m a painter turned software engineer from Daytona,
                Florida. I specialize in the backend, primarily Node and Rust,
                but love building with whatever tools are right for the job.

              <p className="leading-relaxed text-zinc-300">
                I currently work for Google on Google Photos. I also toss in my
                ¬¢2 with the design systems teams from time to time (once an
                artist, always an artist, amirite?).

                Outside of work, I still love to paint. Any given Sunday
                you&apos;ll find me scribbling some happy clouds with my son ‚òÅÔ∏è
                I even teach courses online if you&apos;re looking to learn!

                I&apos;m passively looking for new positions where I can merge
                my love for code with my love for the canvas. If you think
                you&apos;ve got an opening that I might like, let&apos;s connect
